## Carl Christensen's ePortfolio


### Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering
The artifact that I am enhancing in the software engineering and design category comes from a reverse engineering course I took serveral terms ago. The purpose of the assignment was to take a compiled executable, look at the corresponding assembly code, and then write the C code that it was compiled from. The program itself was a tool for professors to analyze and edit student’s grades. It had a simple credentials sysem fory verifying the professor trying to log in. This artifact is a good addition to my portfolio because it shows my proficiency with difficult skills and topics. I had to have a solid grasp of how programs operate “under the hood”, and this artifact does a good job at demonstrating that. The enhancements took this demonstration a step further by showing my ability to identify weaknesses in existing code and then develop solutions to addres the weaknesses. I used security practices for storing user credentials safely, and improved the design of the software by organizing adding the functionality of multiple different accounts, rather than just one.
	Fortunately,  the enhancement development process has been smooth. I feel that the enhancements I have completed so far have met the objectives that I had wanted, specifically the objectives referring to using well-founded techniques and developing with a security mindset. The hashing strategy for storing user credentials and allowing support for multiple user passwords are both techniques that are common place in real-world scenarios. In addition to this, hashing passwords is a very common security feature of most log-in systems. Currently there are no updates on the expected outcome coverage plans.
	The modification of this artifact has taught me a lot in the way of secure development. Before working on these enhancements, I had only a high-level view of how the password security process worked. However now that I have had the opporunity to implement the logic for myself, I feel like I have a mush more solid grasp of it. I would say the biggest challenge that I faced during the development of these enhacements would be the handling of strings in C. Strings are notoriously touchy in the C langauge, and all the file reading, password hashing, and string comparison left a lot of string work to be done. Fortunately though I was able to get through the development without too many scrapes and the code works just as I want it to.
### Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures

### Enhancement 3: Databases

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cpchristensen/cpchristensen.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cpchristensen/cpchristensen.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
